# Username and Password QR Code Generator


# Purpose
Useful for generating QR codes for quick and easy logins. The original purpose of this project was for my job. I wanted
to make an easy way for someone to generate the login for their RF Device (Zebra MC3300). However, I think someone else
could find use for it as well.

# Scope
Allows the end user to enter their username and password (for whatever system) and generate a QR code both on screen
and with the option to print. If the print option is toggled, the QR Code will print on the default printer set in Windows.
Personally, I use it with a Zebra ZT411 with 2X2 labels.

# Other
Upon using the program, a 'QR_Codes' folder will be made in the running directory. Every QR Code generated will be stored
as an image file with the entered username as the filename.
